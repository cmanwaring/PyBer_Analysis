# PyBerAnalysis
## Purpose:

Our purpose in the analysis is to perform an exploratory analysis on the data and then create visualizations to tell a story about the data. 

Create a variety of charts to showcase the relationship between type of city, number of drivers and riders;
% of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.

Access to ride to ride sharing services and determine affordability to under-services neighborhoods.

## Results:
We analyzed the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare by city type; for each type of city.

 - **Total Rides: 2375 (100%)**
   - Rural       125 (5.3%)
   - Suburban    625 (26.3%)
   - Urban       1,625 (68.4%)

 - **Total Drivers: 2,973 (100%)**
   - Rural       78 (2.6.%)
   - Suburban    490 (16.4%)
   - Urban       2,405

 - **Total Fares: $63,538.64 (100%)**
   - Rural       $4,327.93 (6.8%)
   - Suburban    $19,356.33 (30.5%)
   - Urban       $39,854.38 (62.7%)

 - **Average Fares: ($26.75)**
   - Rural       $34.62
   - Suburban    $30.97
   - Urban       $24.53

 - **Average Fares per Driver: ($21.73)**
   -Rural       $55.49
   -Suburban    $39.50
   -Urban       $16.57

**Average # of Rides per Driver: (0.8)**
  -Rural       1.60
  -Suburban    1.28
  -Urban       0.68

## Summary:
1) Urban areas generate significantly more revenues than Suburban or Rural areas. Expand operations to new large cities to increase company assets.
2) Rural drivers seem to stay the busiest and make the best money, as Rural numbers are skewing the data upwards when calculating averages for fares and rides per driver.
3) In Urban areas there are more drivers than there are rides. Inactive drivers in urban areas skew numbers to where there is less than one ride per driver in urban areas. Maybe incorporate an inactivity function to remove inactive drivers from data to get more accurate results.
